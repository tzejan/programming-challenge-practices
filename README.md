# programming-challenge-practices

This is a collection of the coding practices that I had done on various platforms, such as Top Coder, Project Euler, HackerEarth, HackerRank, CodeWars, etc.

They are in no way organized ( I will try to do that if time permits ), and they are not meant for human consumption. This is because the codes were meant to solve the stated problems and learning about how the algorithms work. In later practices, I have included the link to the original problem, and hopefully that gives a clue on what's the problem I was trying to solve.

Some of my other solutions were not listed here because they could be completed in a few lines on the platform without debugging on my machine, hence I had no record of those solutions.
